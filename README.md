<h1>Grand Theft Auto Online Machine Learning Model Data Analysis (A Hefty Title) ðŸš”</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<li>A collaborative Random Forrest machine learning algorithm we used that would be able to determine specific methods of increasing GTA Online player
  activity based on 3 months of logged activity data. We were able to accurately determine which activities are possible ways to increase player
  activity with an accuracy of 82%.
</li>
<h2>Can I see the results?</h2>
<li>Yes! The link is 
  <a href = "https://github.com/SaulTopete/gta-online-ml-model-analysis/blob/main/GTA_Final_Report_Code.pdf">here</a>! We have a full report
  explaining what we did and the results of our process.
</li>
<h2>What makes this project special?</h2>
<li>We love Grand Theft Auto, and it was exciting to apply our data science skills to something we enjoy and produce results that 
could benefit Rockstar Games.</li>
